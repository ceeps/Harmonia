     <h1>University of Harmonia</h1><br />Harmonia was designed as a university town and so naturally has its university at the heart of the town.<br /><br />
 
The University offers teaching of a high standard across its numerous departments, a wide range of subjects to study from and amazing job opportunities amongst other things. It also has state of the art equipment in all of its departments and facilities. Friendly and approachable staff are also a major asset to the University. <br /><br />

Students that have been to the University of Harmonia are constantly recommending it to their friends and family. This is partially due to the high standards of teaching, high student satisfaction and that every student can usually get a high paying job within six months of leaving the university.<br /><br />

One of the facilities that is a major part of the university is its library, which provides students with a tranquil studying/learning environment. The library has six floors, three large computing rooms and an automated self-service check-out system. Books are organised into the department(s) in which they belong, with similar departments being on the same floor. The library is located just off the centre of the university area.<br /><br />

Another facility is the Student Shop, which is a shop where students can buy stationary and snacks as well as other university items. The shop is easily accessible to students as it is opposite the library in the central area. <br /><br />

A radio station is a third example of the universities facilities. The radio station is run by current students and can be tuned into anywhere in Harmonia. Although the University's radio station has only been up and running for the past five years; it has been very successful mostly due to its enticing competitions. <br /><br />

There are many small parks between the various university buildings. These parks add scenery to the students walk between the buildings. They also provided them with areas to rest and meet with other students. As well as having flowers and trees, the parks have statues and sculptors that previous students have made during their time at the university. One of the parks has a statue of the Greek goddess Harmonia.<br /><br />
